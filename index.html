<a id="seo-scripts" class="anchor" href="#seo-scripts" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>SEO Scripts.</h3>

<p>This is a collection of scripts in Bash, Python, Ubot script or god old Windows batch files. Don't expect anything new or revolutionary here as most of it has been begged, borrowed or stolen from elsewhere on the internet or from smarter people's brains.  These are some of the scripts that we find useful on regular basis and in the true spirit of the interwebs we  at<a href="http://www.danangdigital.net/">DanangDigital</a> want to give something back. We'll be uploading the balance of files over the coming months. </p>

<h3>
<a id="gsa-ser-scripts" class="anchor" href="#gsa-ser-scripts" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>GSA SER Scripts</h3>

<p>Most of these have been taken from Beck's nice page over at SerTips and were written in Python. And have saved a huge amount of work over the years. </p>

<h3>
<a id="ubot-scripts" class="anchor" href="#ubot-scripts" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Ubot Scripts</h3>

<p>The Ubot scripts and scraps are more for reference than anything else and came from the Ubot forum.</p>

<h3>
<a id="server-build-scripts" class="anchor" href="#server-build-scripts" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Server Build Scripts</h3>

<p>These have come in very handy over time and have been put together from numerous sources and a lot of time, trial and errors.</p>

<p>Feel free to suggest changes modifications and improvements.</p>
